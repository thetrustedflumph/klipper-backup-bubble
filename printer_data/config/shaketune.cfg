result_folder: ~/printer_data/config/ShakeTune_results
#    The folder where the results will be stored. It will be created if it doesn't exist.
number_of_results_to_keep: 3
#    The number of results to keep in the result_folder. The oldest results will
#    be automatically deleted after each runs.
keep_raw_data: False
#    If True, the raw CSV files will be kept in the result_folder alongside the
#    PNG graphs. If False, they will be deleted and only the graphs will be kept.
show_macros_in_webui: True
#    Mainsail and Fluidd doesn't create buttons for "system" macros that are not in the
#    printer.cfg file. If you want to see the macros in the webui, set this to True.
timeout: 600
#    The maximum time in seconds to let Shake&Tune process the CSV files and generate the graphs.
measurements_chunk_size: 5
#    Each Shake&Tune command uses the accelerometer to take multiple measurements. By default,
#    Shake&Tune will write a chunk of data to disk every two measurements, and at the end of the
#    command will merge these chunks into the final .stdata file for processing. "2" is a very
#    conservative setting to avoid Klipper Timer Too Close errors on lower end devices with little
#    RAM, and should work for everyone. However, if you are using a powerful computer, you may
#    wish to increase this value to keep more measurements in memory (e.g., 15-20) before writing
#    the chunk and avoid stressing the filesystem too much.
max_freq: 200
#    This setting defines the maximum frequency at which the calculation of the power spectral density
#    is cutoff. The default value should be fine for most machines and accelerometer combinations and
#    avoid touching it unless you know what you're doing.
